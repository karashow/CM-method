# CM-method

A working implementation of the CM method is given.
We provide the ingedients to construct elliptic curves over the finite field GF(p) with a prescribed number of 
rational points. In particular:
  - The class polynomials.
  - The Cornacchia algorithm.  

## Class polynomials

Hilbert polynomials and Weber gamma-polynomials 


## Arithmetic functions
