# CM method

A working implementation of the CM method is given.
We provide an algorithm (the CM method) to construct elliptic curves over the finite field GF(p) with a prescribed number of 
rational points. The major ingredients are:
  - the class polynomials;
  - the Cornacchia algorithm.  

## Class polynomials

Hilbert polynomials and Weber gamma-polynomials 


## Arithmetic functions
